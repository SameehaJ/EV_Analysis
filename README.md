# üöó Driving Change: Analyzing EV Adoption Trends Across the U.S.

## üìò Background and Overview

This project presents a comprehensive Excel-based analysis of electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends in the U.S. using public data on EV registrations. The focus is on understanding how Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) are distributed geographically, how they differ in performance, and how CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility affects adoption.

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/electric-vehicle-population-data), includes over 114,000 records and was cleaned and analyzed using Power Query, Pivot Tables, Map Charts, and dynamic Excel formulas to build a multi-sheet interactive dashboard.

## üéØ Project Requirements and Objectives

### Key Goals:
- Understand EV market size and growth across the U.S.
- Compare BEVs and PHEVs in terms of volume and range
- Analyze eligibility for CAFV incentives
- Identify high-adoption regions and leading brands
- Visualize trends with an engaging Excel dashboard

---

## üìä Executive Summary

- BEVs represent over 76% of all EVs in the dataset
- Tesla leads in both registration count and electric range
- PHEVs commonly fall short of CAFV eligibility
- Washington State shows the highest EV adoption
- Policy, performance, and local incentives drive adoption diversity

## üóÉÔ∏è Data Structure Overview

### Dataset Columns (Raw):
- **VIN (1‚Äì10):** First 10 characters of vehicle ID  
- **Geography:** State, County, City, ZIP  
- **Vehicle Info:** Model Year, Make, Model, EV Type

## üßπ Data Cleaning (Power Query)

### Steps Taken:
- Used Power Query for step-by-step data prep
- Removed irrelevant columns (e.g., MSRP, Utility)
- Ensured clean, valid column types and structures
- Created a ‚ÄúCleaned Data‚Äù sheet as the analysis base

## üí° Recommendations

### For Policymakers:
- Clarify CAFV program details to buyers
- Reassess range criteria to include more PHEVs
- Address equity in how incentives are distributed

### For Automakers:
- Improve PHEV range to meet CAFV standards
- Report accurate range to ensure eligibility
- Build appeal beyond performance alone

### For Infrastructure Planners:
- Prioritize charging access in low-adoption zones
- Support both long- and short-range EVs
